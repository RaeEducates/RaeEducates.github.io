<h2>Where It Started</h2>
<h3>"It's been a long time comin'".</h3>
  <p><b>Blackpool is actually one of the newer towns that came along within the United Kingdom. Only starting around the 1700s, it was a very small and humble little place where only some 
    buildings were built there. Of course, after some time, it had started to bloom into something more and progressively became more successful. However, something interesting that our
    interviewee claims is that there was a point in time in which the United Kingdom had stopped using trams, a convenient way of travel. Though, Blackpool decided otherwise and decided to keep
    using them because they found that the use of trams was easier than that of personal transport. It isn't until recently that the rest of the United Kingdom realised this fact and is 
    starting to try and use them again. Admittadely, travel was incredibly simple and fast within Blackpool, and the surrounding cities struggled a bit.

<h2>How It's Going</h2>
<h3>"Honestly, crackin'".</h3>
<p><b>After looking in history meuseums and hearing what our interviewee has had to say about Blackpool, it is really easy to come to the conclusion that the locals are really pround 
  of how Blackpool has come together. The old buildings, the community, and the history all showcase how much care and time has gone into this tourist town. They have not only those 
  that came before them to start this town off, but also themselves for continuing to make it a great place for others to enjoy.
