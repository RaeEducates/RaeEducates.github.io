<h2>Blackpool Tower</h2>
<h3>"She's a real beaut', don't tell me missus, though".</h3>
  <p><b>The Blackpool Tower is one of the most iconic structures here in Blackpool, and it is really hard to miss! Standing at 519' tall, it was constructed in 1891, and fully open to the public
    in 1894. You can not only see it from cities away, you can also go up it via elevator and see so much of Blackpool and it's surrounding cities. Additionally, within the public
    tour of this structure, we were informed that this has to get repainted roughly every few years because they live by the shore; rust and general environmental factors also come into play.
    Within this structure, you'll find a beautiful ballroom that still is in use for plays and dances.

<h2>Blackpool Zoo</h2>
<h3>"I like the otters, the wee fellas".</h3>
<p><b>Not too far away from the center of it all, we have the Blackpool Zoo. Home to over 1300 animals, there are so many creatures to look at and learn about. Each animal pen is 
  upkept to very high standards, and it is clear to see that each and every single one of these animals are cared for greatly. They all have so much space to play in, and the visitors here 
  are all very respectful. Additionally, there are several places to eat here within the center of the zoo, incase you get hungry.

<h2>Stanley Park</h2>
<h3>"Great for walkin' if I can get off me bum".</h3>
<p><b>The absolute beautiful park that is Stanley Park is an amazing place to go on walks, jogs, or even simple bike rides. This park is in a fantastic location for surrounding residents,
  and it has a lot to offer other than travel. There are cafes, boat rides, and even an ice cream shop for visitors to enjoy. Though, during the winter time the various ponds might
  freeze over. One can also take notice to the gorgeous array of flowers that are displayed, and these are upkept amazingly well, and people do not dare to even walk on them. These flowers
  are here all year round, bar the winter times, and they are a great site to see - and smell!

  <h2>Pleasure Beach</h2>
  <h3>"You've gotta go there, innit".</h3>
  <p><b>Home to one of the largest rollercoasters in the world is here at Pleasure Beach. This amusement park has around 10 rollercoasters, one of which used to be the biggest
    one in the world, called "The Big One". Though I was too fearful to go on it, others race to get on it as soon as they can. Soaring at 235', it is fair to say that it is a 
    hefty drop. Make sure to not eat beforehand!
    With that being said, there are so many other rides to enjoy if you find yourself fearful of heights. There is a various assortment of rides that cater to many different ages,
    varying in height, speed, and fun. There is even a whole section dedicated to rides that depict cartoons.
