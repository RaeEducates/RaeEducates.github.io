    <h2>Welcome to Blackpool!</h2>
    <h3>"What's a Californian doing here?"</h3>
      <p><b>I had the chance to visit the fantastic town of Blackpool! Located along the west coast of the United Kingdom, Blackpool sits there as a great
        tourist destination for all with it's many attractions. I also had the pleasure of interviewing own of their locals, who has resided in this comfy town
        for roughly 20 years. They described Blackpool's many features and sites to see, as well as many interesting facts! They made sure to cover a wide range of topics such as their location,
        local history, attractions, and even art exhibits. They were also very eager to showcase their local <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/imagesofblackpool" target="_blank">
        Facebook page</a> that has many pictures to share, and I am happily showcasing some of them within this site. If you're thinking about visiting Blackpool, or even just want
        to know more about it from a local's perspective, explore this website.

<!--
  In regards to Accessibility, identify two practices that you put into place for your site?
        I made sure to incorporate a nav bar as well as a functional scroll gallery (thanks to W3Schools). Also, I made use of some of the help that you
        gave me, in regards to the wrapper and sections.

  What is one additional thing that you did on this site that was not done on your B&B site?
        I tried to have a lot more fun with the colors on my website, because the colors on my Bed and Breakfast website seemed a bit bland. I was really nervous
        to play around with the colors on the Bed and Breakfast site in fear that it would be too crazy and not fun to look at. I decided to go outside of
        my comfort zone within this project. The colors on this site seem a lot more chaotic, but it accurately represents Blackpool quite well. 

  Did you use any form of ideation in an effort to create a plan prior to building your site? Why or why not?
        I made a simple layout via Canva and I did research on the colors that are commonly associated with the town of Blackpool. 
        This made it a whole lot easier to get a better idea of what I wanted my website to look like.
