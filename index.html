<p><b>We take pride in offering our guests the best of service each and every day that they stay at our Bed and Breakfast! We thank you for sharing your time with us and for leaving such kind reviews.</b>

<p><b>We rented the entire Bed and Breakfast for a bachelorette weekend before
   my wedding. The staff was great, the rooms were clean, 
   and they did all they could to make our time there special<em style="float: right;">~Maria</em></b></p>
 
  <p><b>My husband booked a room for us for our 25th anniversary and it was wonderful. 
    They provided us with a gift basket in our room to celebrate at no additional charge 
    and we spent time together exploring the town. I would stay here again in the future.<em style="float: right;">~Karla M.</em></b></p>
 
    <p><b>We wanted to find someplace to stay near a ski resort that was more personal. 
      We had such a lovely time at Home away from Home. It was close to the ski resort 
      and we were able to get discounted tickets because we were staying at a local business. 
      They were very welcoming and our stay was great!<em style="float: right;">~Justine</em></b></p>
