    <h2>The Wave</h2>
    <h3>"This is me favorite this is".</h3>
    <p><b>Blackpool is home to so many different art pieces, however these are by far not only my favorite, but the locals favorite. Firstly, located right in the middle of 
      Blackpool Town Center is a sculpture called "The Wave". Standing at roughly 10 meters tall and made of steel, it serves as a beautiful representation of their nearby beach. Additionally,
      there are LED's within this sculpture so that it is constantly changing colors. However, we observed that a lot of people quite liked to run as high up it as they could and jump off of it.
      It serves as a makeshift playground for those that appreciate art in a different manner.

<h2>Mary's Shell</h2>
<h3>"When have they done this?"</h3>
  <p><b>On one of the many beaches here in Blackpool, there is a sculpture called "Mary's Shell". It is based off of a fantasy book that people had commonly read when they were younger,
    and it represents parks of that book within this sculpture. This sculpture also serves as a little play area for people to go inside and out whenever the tide allows them to. It is 
    a display of fun and creativity for all to enjoy.

<h2>Spitfire Tribute</h2>
<h3>"They ain't even to scale, the scammin' artist".</h3>
  <p><b>Right in the middle of a roundabout we have the Spitfire Tribute sculptures. Though they are not to scale, they are actually bigger models of the toy spitfires that are commonly
    made and sold for people to build. These toys are found in shops all around Blackpool, and artist thought it would be fun to have closer to life size versions of these toys. Additionally,
    the Royal Air Force is held highly within this town, so it serves as a sign of resepect to those as well. A good amount of people from Blackpool enroll, and this sculpture
    showcases that responsibility.
