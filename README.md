<h1>BEING AN ARTIST</h1>

<h2>My Inspiration</h2>
<details>
    <summary>A various amount of content inspired me...</summary><!--I researched these cool detail/summary tags online that allow the user to click on the arrow next to the text and it make additional text show-->
    <p>As I was growing up, I found myself staying indoors quite often. In order to not be bored all of the time, I watched a lot of cartoons on the Television.<br/>
        With this, I started to draw said characters from the screen, as they made me happy. I struggled to make friends, and I felt like there was a connection<br/> between me and the characters on the screen.
        So I guess cartoons like Spongebob Squarepants and the like are largely responsible for my artistic hobby. <br/>Though my art does not resemble cartoon like themes today, I still
        recall where this all started.

<h2>My Favorite Medium</h2>
<details>
    <summary>I have taken a liking to many art forms...</summary><!--I made use of these detail/summary tags by incorporating them with the paragraph tags-->
    <p>Though I used to adore the world of crayons and markers, I started to look towards other means of art. After going through several art courses throughout<br/> my duration of school,
        I found myself adoring one specific medium; pencil. Making art with a pencil is so reliable because one is able to simply erase<br/> what they were attempting to draw. Additionally,
        the different variety of pencils allowing for more dark or lighter shades makes it all the better. With this,<br/> pencils are found virtually everywhere; they are easy to bring along
        on any journey and can be very handy.
